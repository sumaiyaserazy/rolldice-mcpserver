- **Validation:** Dice sides between 2-1000
- **Technology:** Zod schema validation
- **Result:** Type-safe, validated input

#### Step 3: Rate Limiting Check
- **Purpose:** Prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- **Validation:** Check requests per minute against limit
- **Current Status:** 15/100 requests per minute
- **Action:** Block if exceeded, log attempt

#### Step 4: OAuth 2.0 Verification
- **Purpose:** Ensure authenticated, authorized access
- **Validation:** Token signature, expiration, scope
- **Token Details:** Scope: mcp:tools:execute | Expires: 2h 45m
- **Result:** Authentication confirmed

#### Step 5: MCP Tool Execution
- **Purpose:** Execute the dice rolling tool
- **Process:** Generate random number within validated range
- **Result:** Return result (e.g., rolled 4 on d6)
- **Performance:** <145ms average execution time

#### Step 6: Audit Logging

### 7.4 Component Architecture

**Design Pattern:** Component-based architecture with React

**Component Types:**
1. **Server Components** (default, SEO-optimized)
   - `app/portfolio/page.tsx`
   - Static content rendering

2. **Client Components** ("use client" directive)
   - `components/mcp-security-demo.tsx`
   - Interactive features

3. **Shared UI Components** (shadcn/ui)
   - `components/ui/card.tsx`
   - `components/ui/badge.tsx`
   - `components/ui/button.tsx`
   - Reusable, accessible

**State Management:**
- React useState for local component state
- No global state needed (component isolation)
- Server state cached by Next.js

**Styling Approach:**
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- CSS variables for theming
- Responsive design with breakpoints
- Dark/light mode support

### 7.5 Deployment Instructions

#### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

**Step 1: Prepare Repository**
```bash
# Ensure all changes committed
git add .
git commit -m "Week 9 portfolio complete"
git push origin main

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# - Link to existing project or create new
# - Configure environment variables
# - Deploy to production
```

**Step 3: Configure Environment Variables in Vercel**
Navigate to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables

Add:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (your production URL)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (if using OAuth)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (if using OAuth)
- `ARCJET_KEY` (if using Arcjet)

**Step 4: Verify Deployment**
- Visit production URL
- Test all portfolio sections
- Verify analytics tracking
